Milestone 2: Creating Models, Serializers, and Seeders
 Weight: 1
 Project will start Nov 10, 2025 12:00 AM, must end by Nov 17, 2025 12:00 AM
 Manual QA review must be done (request it when you are done with the project)
Overview
This task guides learners through creating essential backend components in Django by defining database models, setting up serializers for API data representation, and implementing a management command to seed the database. By working on the duplicated alx_travel_app_0x00 project, learners will gain practical experience in structuring relational data, serializing it for API endpoints, and programmatically populating the database with sample data to simulate real-world application scenarios.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this task, learners should be able to:

Model relational data in Django using appropriate fields, relationships, and constraints.
Create serializers to transform Django model instances into JSON for API responses.
Implement a management command to automate database seeding.
Test and validate database population using Django’s command-line tools.
Learning Outcomes
Learners will be able to:

Define models such as Listing, Booking, and Review with correct relationships (e.g., ForeignKey, OneToMany).
Use Django REST Framework (DRF) serializers to prepare model data for APIs.
Write and execute a seeding script to insert realistic sample data into the database.
Apply database seeding to streamline development and testing workflows.
Key Concepts
Django Models – Mapping Python classes to database tables.
Relationships – Implementing one-to-many and many-to-one associations between models.
Constraints – Ensuring data integrity with validation rules.
Serializers – Converting complex data types into JSON for APIs using DRF.
Management Commands – Extending Django’s CLI to perform custom tasks.
Database Seeding – Populating databases with sample or default data.
Tools & Libraries
Django – Backend framework for building the application.
Django REST Framework (DRF) – For creating API serializers and endpoints.
SQLite/PostgreSQL – Database engines for storing data.
Python – Programming language for backend logic and scripts.
Real-World Use Case
In a travel booking platform, developers need to design data structures for listings (properties available for booking), customer bookings, and user reviews. Serializers ensure this data can be delivered via APIs to mobile or web clients. During development, seeding the database with sample listings allows frontend developers and testers to work with realistic data without manually creating entries, significantly speeding up the development lifecycle and ensuring consistent test scenarios.

Tasks
0. Database Modeling and Data Seeding in Django
mandatory
Objective

Define the database models, create serializers for API data representation, and implement a management command to seed the database.

Instructions

Duplicate Project:

Duplicate the project alx_travel_app to alx_travel_app_0x00
Create Models:

In listings/models.py, define Listing, Booking, and Review models based on the provided structure.
Each model should have appropriate fields, relationships, and constraints.
Set Up Serializers:

Create serializers in listings/serializers.py for Listing and Booking models.
Implement Seeders:

Create a management command in listings/management/commands/seed.py to populate the database with sample listings data.
Run Seed Command:

Test the seeder by running the command to populate the database with sample data.
