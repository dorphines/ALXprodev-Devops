Overview
The Airbnb Clone is a backend application designed to mimic the core functionality of Airbnb. It will provide a RESTful API (or GraphQL) that handles user accounts, property listings, booking reservations, and payment processing. This documentation phase focuses on creating a blueprint for the system, covering everything from high-level feature lists to low-level API specifications before a single line of code is written.

Learning Objectives
By completing this documentation project, you will learn how to:

Translate project requirements into a structured list of features and functionalities.
Model system interactions visually using Use Case Diagrams to identify actors and their goals.
Articulate user needs by writing clear User Stories that guide development from a user-centric perspective.
Map data movement through the system using Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to understand how information is processed.
Detail specific processes with Flowcharts to define logical sequences and decision points.
Write precise technical specifications that define API endpoints, data validation, and system behavior for developers.
Utilize diagramming tools like Draw.io to create professional and clear technical diagrams.
Key Concepts
Backend Architecture: The structure of the server-side application, including routers, controllers, models, and services.
RESTful API Design: Creating endpoints that adhere to REST principles using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.
Data Modeling: Designing the database schema (e.g., using SQL like PostgreSQL or NoSQL) to efficiently store and relate data (Users, Properties, Bookings, etc.).
Authentication & Authorization: Implementing mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to verify user identity (AuthN) and control access to resources (AuthZ).
Payment Gateway Integration: Securely processing payments using third-party services like Stripe or PayPal.
Documentation: The practice of creating clear, maintainable, and comprehensive guides and specifications for a software project.
Tools and Libraries
Draw.io / Diagrams.net: A free, online diagramming tool for creating Use Case Diagrams, DFDs, and Flowcharts.
Git & GitHub: For version control and hosting the documentation repository.
Markdown: A lightweight markup language for formatting the README.md and other documentation files.
Node.js & Express.js (Potential): Likely JavaScript runtime and web framework for building the backend.
Database (Potential): PostgreSQL ( relational) or MongoDB (non-relational).
Authentication (Potential): bcrypt for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for JWTs.
Payments (Potential): Stripe API SDK.
Real-World Use Case
This documentation directly simulates the initial phases of a real-world software development lifecycle (SDLC) at any tech company. Before engineers start coding, Product Managers, System Analysts, and Technical Leads collaborate to produce exactly these kinds of artifacts:

Product Requirements Doc (PRD): The list of features (Task 0).
System Design Mockups: Use Case and Data Flow diagrams (Tasks 1 & 3).
Agile/Scrum Backlog Items: User Stories (Task 2).
Technical Specifications: Detailed API and requirement docs (Task 5). This process ensures everyone is aligned, reduces development errors, and provides a clear roadmap for the engineering team.

Tasks
0. Documenting Project Features and Functionalities
mandatory
Objective: Identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone project.

Instructions:

Review the project requirements for the Airbnb Clone backend here.

Using Draw.io, create a detailed document that lists all the features and functionalities the backend needs to support. This should include user authentication, property management, booking system, and payments.

Export your design as a PNG file and store it in a directory called features-and-functionalities/ within your GitHub repository alx-airbnb-project-documentation.

Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
Directory: features-and-functionalities/
File: README.md
1. Design the Use Case Diagram of the Features and Functionalities
mandatory
Objective: Visualize system interactions using a use case diagram.

Instructions:

Based on the features outlined in Task 1, use Draw.io to create a use case diagram that visualizes the interactions between users and the system for key functionalities like user registration, property booking, and payments.

Ensure that all key actors and interactions are captured in the diagram.

Export your diagram as a PNG file and store it in a directory called use-case-diagram/ within your GitHub repository alx-airbnb-project-documentation.

Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
Directory: use-case-diagram/
File: README.md
2. Convert Your Use Case Diagram to User Stories
mandatory
Objective: Translate use case diagram interactions into user stories.

Instructions:

Using the use case diagram from Task 1, convert each use case into a relevant user story. Example: “As a user, I want to be able to register an account so that I can list my properties.”

Write at least 5 user stories that capture the core interactions from the use case diagram.

Create a file named user-stories.md in the directory user-stories/ within your GitHub repository alx-airbnb-project-documentation and document your user stories there.

Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
Directory: user-stories/
File: user-stories.md,README.md
3. Design a Data Flow Diagram for Your Features and Functionalities
mandatory
Objective: Create a data flow diagram (DFD) to map the data flow within the system.

Instructions:

Based on the features and functionalities identified in Task 1, design a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) using Draw.io that illustrates how data moves through the system. Include key entities like users, properties, bookings, and payments.

The DFD should cover data inputs, processes, and outputs for core backend operations.

Export your diagram as a PNG file as data-flow.png and store it in a directory called data-flow-diagram/ within your GitHub repository alx-airbnb-project-documentation.

Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
Directory: data-flow-diagram/
4. Design a Flowchart for System Processes
mandatory
Objective: Map the workflow and processes of the backend features.

Instructions:

Choose one of the key backend processes (e.g., user registration, property booking) and design a flowchart in Draw.io to visualize the steps and data flow for this process.

Export the flowchart as a PNG and store it in the flowcharts directory under the alx-airbnb-project-documentation GitHub repository.

Commit and push the changes to your repository.

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-airbnb-project-documentation
Directory: flowcharts/

5. Write Requirement Specifications for Backend Features
mandatory
Objective: Document the technical and functional requirements for each feature.

Instructions:

Write detailed requirement specifications for at least three key backend features from Task 1 (e.g., User Authentication, Property Management, Booking System).

Include API endpoints, input/output specifications, validation rules, and performance criteria.

Document this in a requirements.md file and store it in the root directory of the alx-airbnb-project-documentation GitHub repository.
