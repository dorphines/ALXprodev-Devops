Understanding Authentication and Permission in Enterprise Applications
Authentication and permission systems are the cornerstone of any secure and scalable backend architecture. Whether you’re building a small SaaS platform or a robust enterprise-grade application, implementing robust user access controls ensures the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of your system’s data.

In Django, authentication and authorization (permissions) are elegantly handled through a combination of built-in tools and extendable frameworks. For mid to senior-level backend engineers, mastering these components is essential not only for technical growth but also for building secure, maintainable, and scalable systems that align with industry standards and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2).

In small-scale apps, authentication may seem straightforward with simple login/signup flows. However, as the application scales, challenges such as multi-role systems, fine-grained permissions, external integrations (OAuth, JWT, SSO), and API security become more critical. Understanding how to implement and customize these systems will empower developers to create backend services that are both user-friendly and enterprise-ready.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

Understand Core Concepts

Define authentication and authorization, and understand how Django handles both.
Differentiate between user roles, groups, and permission sets.
Implement Authentication

Build custom user models and extend Django’s default User model.
Implement session-based and token-based (e.g., JWT) authentication.
Integrate third-party authentication services (e.g., OAuth2, SSO).
Design Permission Systems

Create custom permissions for models, views, and APIs.
Use Django’s permissions_required, @login_required, and DRF permissions.
Implement object-level permissions for more granular control.
Secure Enterprise APIs

Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) for enterprise applications.
Combine authentication with throttling and rate limiting for production use.
Audit and Monitor Access

Set up logging, user activity tracking, and audit trails.
Understand best practices for secure password storage, account recovery, and session handling.
Expected Learning Outcomes
Learners will:

Build robust authentication flows using Django and Django REST Framework.
Develop scalable permission layers for small to enterprise-grade apps.
Apply security principles to protect APIs and sensitive endpoints.
Gain confidence in integrating third-party identity providers (IdPs) and implementing custom permissions.
Understand how to structure user roles and access hierarchies in complex systems.

Tasks
0. Implement Authentication
mandatory
Objective: Add user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or Session Authentication.

Instructions:

Install djangorestframework-simplejwt for JWT Authentication.

Configure the authentication settings in the settings.py. More on how to: here

Ensure all users can access their own messages and conversations

Directory: messaging_app
File: messaging_app/settings.py, messaging_app/chats/auth.py, messaging_app/urls.py, messaging_app/chats/permissions.py
1. Add Permissions
mandatory
Objective: Create custom permission classes to control access.

Instructions:

Create and extend the permissions class IsParticipantOfConversation to:

Allow only authenticated users to access the api
Allow only participants in a conversation to send, view, update and delete messages
Apply the custom permissions to your viewsets to enforce access control

Update your settings.py to set default permissions globally

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-backend-python
Directory: messaging_app
File: chats/permissions.py, chats/Views.py, messaging_app/settings.py
2. Pagination and Filtering
mandatory
Objective: implement pagination and filtering for messages

Instructions:

Add pagination listing on the messages such that the api fetches 20 messages per page. Resource: here

Using django-filters , Add filtering class MessageFilter to your views to retrieve conversations with specific users or messages within a time range

3. Testing the API Endpoints
mandatory
Objective: Use postman to test api endpoints

Instructions:

Test creating a conversation, sending messages and fetching conversations

Test authentication (JWT token login) and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access private conversations.
