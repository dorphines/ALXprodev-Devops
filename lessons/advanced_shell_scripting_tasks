Project Overview & Summary
This project is a practical deep dive into Advanced Shell Scripting, focusing on automating interactions with a RESTful API (the Pokémon API). It progresses from simple, single API calls to complex operations involving parallel processing, robust error handling, and data summarization. The goal is to simulate real-world DevOps and Data Engineering tasks where automation, reliability, and efficiency are paramount.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn and demonstrate proficiency in:

API Interaction: Making HTTP requests from the command line using curl.
JSON Manipulation: Parsing, filtering, and extracting data from JSON responses using jq.
Text Processing: Utilizing the UNIX text processing trifecta (grep, sed, awk) to transform and format data.
Robust Scripting: Implementing error handling, status checking, and retry logic to create reliable automation scripts.
Process Management: Using shell job control (&, wait, $!) to run tasks in parallel, significantly improving script performance.
Data Reporting: Aggregating data from multiple sources and generating structured reports (e.g., CSV files).
Modular Design: Structuring scripts to be maintainable and adaptable for future changes.
Key Concepts
HTTP Status Codes: Checking curl exit codes or HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK vs. 404 Not Found) to determine the success or failure of a request.
Idempotency and Retries: Designing operations to be safely retried in case of transient network failures.
Rate Limiting: Understanding the constraints of external APIs and implementing delays to avoid being blocked.
Concurrency vs. Parallelism: Using background processes to achieve parallelism in a shell environment, understanding the associated challenges (e.g., shared resources, output interleaving).
Data Pipelines: Building a complete pipeline: data extraction (API) -> transformation (parsing) -> loading (saving to files) -> reporting (summary/analytics).
Tools and Libraries
curl: The primary tool for transferring data from or to a server. Used to make GET requests to the Pokémon API.
jq: A lightweight and powerful command-line JSON processor. Essential for parsing the API response and extracting specific fields.
awk: A versatile programming language for pattern scanning and processing. Used for text extraction, report generation, and calculating averages.
sed: A stream editor for filtering and transforming text. Used for specific text substitutions.
Core Shell Utilities: grep, cut, echo, variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and process control (&&, ||).
Real-World Use Case
This project mirrors a common pattern in cloud and data engineering:

A Data Engineer needs to build a pipeline to collect data from various external SaaS platforms (e.g., Salesforce, Shopify, Twitter API) on a daily basis. 1. Extraction: The scripts from Tasks 0, 2, 4, and 5 represent the data extraction layer. They must be robust, handle API failures gracefully, and efficiently pull data from all required endpoints. 2. Transformation: The scripts from Tasks 1 and 3 represent the transformation layer. Raw JSON data is parsed, cleaned, and formatted into a more usable structure (like a CSV) for analysts. 3. Loading: The final JSON and CSV files are the loaded data, ready to be consumed by a database or a Business Intelligence (BI) tool like Tableau or Power BI.

The skills practiced here are directly applicable to building ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) or ELT pipelines using shell scripts, which is a lightweight and powerful approach for many tasks.

Tasks
0. API Request Automation
mandatory
Objective: Automate the process of making API requests to the Pokémon API and saving the results to a file

Instructions:

Write a shell script that makes a request to the Pokémon API and retrieves data for a specific Pokémon Pikachu.

It should save the response to a json file: data.json

If the request fails, it should log the error to an error file: errors.txt

Sample Output

ghostmode@GhostMode:~$ jq . < data.json | head -n 50

1. Extract Pokémon Data
mandatory
Objective: Use advanced text manipulation tools (jq, awk, sed) to extract specific data from the API response.

Instructions:

Write a script that extracts the Pokémon’s name, height, weight, and type from the JSON file created in Task 0.

Format the output in a human-readable way,“Pikachu is of type Electric, weighs 6kg, and is 0.4m tall.”

You should only use these commands: jq, awk, sed

Sample Output:

ghostmode@GhostMode:~$ ./parse_pikachu
Pikachu is of type Electric, weighs 6kg, and is 0.4m tall.

2. Batch Pokémon Data Retrieval
mandatory
Objective: Automate the retrieval of data for multiple Pokémon and store it in separate files.

Instructions:

Create a script that loops through a list of Pokémon [Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Charmander, Charmeleon]

For each Pokémon, retrieve its data from the API and save it to a separate file named after the Pokémon (e.g., pikachu.json, bulbasaur.json…).

Handle any potential rate-limiting issues by adding a delay between requests.

Sample Output:

ghostmode@GhostMode:~$ ./fetch_multiple_pokemon
Fetching data for bulbasaur...
Saved data to pokemon_data/bulbasaur.json ✅
Fetching data for ivysaur...
Saved data to pokemon_data/ivysaur.json ✅
Fetching data for venusaur...
Saved data to pokemon_data/venusaur.json ✅
Fetching data for charmander...
Saved data to pokemon_data/charmander.json ✅
Fetching data for charmeleon...
Saved data to pokemon_data/charmeleon.json ✅

3. Summarize Pokémon Data
mandatory
Objective: Create a report that summarizes data for multiple Pokémon.

Instructions:

Write a shell script that reads all the JSON files generated in Task 2 and extracts the name, height, and weight of each Pokémon.

Generate a CSV file containing the Pokémon’s name, height, and weight.

Use awk to calculate the average height and weight of all Pokémon in the report.

Sample Output:

ghostmode@GhostMode:~$ ./pokemon_report
CSV Report generated at: pokemon_report.csv

Name,Height (m),Weight (kg)
Bulbasaur,0.7,6.9
Charmander,0.6,8.5
Charmeleon,1.1,19.0
Ivysaur,1.0,13.0
Venusaur,2.0,100.0

Average Height: 1.08 m
Average Weight: 29.48 kg

4. Error Handling and Retry Logic
mandatory
Objective: Add robust error handling and retry logic for API requests.

Instructions:

Modify the script from Task 2 to handle potential errors (e.g., network issues, invalid Pokémon names).

If an API request fails, implement a retry mechanism that attempts the request up to 3 times before logging the error and skipping to the next Pokémon.

Directory: Advanced_shell
File: batchProcessing-0x02
5. Parallel Data Fetching
mandatory
Objective: Speed up data retrieval using parallel processing.

Instructions:

Write a script that fetches data for these Pokémon[Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Charmander, Charmeleon ] in parallel by leveraging background processes and process management tools.

Ensure that the script handles background processes properly and waits for all processes to complete before moving to the next step.
