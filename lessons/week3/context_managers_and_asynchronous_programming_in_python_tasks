Overview
This project demonstrates advanced Python techniques for managing database connections and executing queries using context managers and asynchronous programming. It provides three key implementations: a custom context manager for database connections, a reusable query executor, and concurrent asynchronous database operations.

Learning Objectives
Implement class-based context managers using __enter__ and __exit__ methods
Understand resource management and automatic cleanup with context managers
Master asynchronous database operations using aiosqlite
Implement concurrent query execution with asyncio.gather
Handle database connections and queries in a Pythonic way
Key Concepts
Context Managers
Context managers ensure proper resource acquisition and release using the with statement pattern. The __enter__ method handles resource setup, while __exit__ guarantees cleanup even if exceptions occur.

Database Connection Management
Proper connection management prevents resource leaks and ensures database integrity. Context managers automatically handle connection opening/closing.

Asynchronous Programming
Using async/await syntax with aiosqlite enables non-blocking database operations, allowing multiple queries to execute concurrently for improved performance.

Concurrent Execution
asyncio.gather() allows multiple asynchronous operations to run simultaneously, significantly reducing total execution time for independent queries.

Tools and Libraries
sqlite3: Standard Python library for SQLite database interactions
aiosqlite: Async-compatible SQLite library for asynchronous operations
asyncio: Python’s built-in asynchronous programming framework
Contextlib: Utilities for creating context managers
Real-World Use Cases
Web Application Backends
Context managers ensure database connections are properly closed after each request, preventing connection leaks in high-traffic web applications.

Data Processing Pipelines
Reusable query context managers simplify ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes where multiple similar queries need execution with different parameters.

Analytics Dashboards
Concurrent asynchronous queries allow dashboards to fetch multiple datasets simultaneously, providing faster load times for users viewing complex reports.

Microservices Architecture
Asynchronous database operations enable services to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently, improving scalability in distributed systems.

Automated Testing
Context managers ensure test databases are properly cleaned up after each test case, maintaining test isolation and reliability.

Tasks
0. custom class based context manager for Database connection
mandatory
Objective: create a class based context manager to handle opening and closing database connections automatically

Instructions:

Write a class custom context manager DatabaseConnection using the __enter__ and the __exit__ methods

Use the context manager with the with statement to be able to perform the query SELECT * FROM users. Print the results from the query.

GitHub repository: alx-backend-python
Directory: python-context-async-perations-0x02
File: 0-databaseconnection.py
1. Reusable Query Context Manager
mandatory
Objective: create a reusable context manager that takes a query as input and executes it, managing both connection and the query execution

Instructions:

Implement a class based custom context manager ExecuteQuery that takes the query: ”SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ?” and the parameter 25 and returns the result of the query

Ensure to use the__enter__() and the __exit__() methods

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-backend-python
Directory: python-context-async-perations-0x02
File: 1-execute.py
2. Concurrent Asynchronous Database Queries
mandatory
Objective: Run multiple database queries concurrently using asyncio.gather.

Instructions:

Use the aiosqlite library to interact with SQLite asynchronously. To learn more about it, click here.

Write two asynchronous functions: async_fetch_users() and async_fetch_older_users() that fetches all users and users older than 40 respectively.

Use the asyncio.gather() to execute both queries concurrently.

Use asyncio.run(fetch_concurrently()) to run the concurrent fetch
