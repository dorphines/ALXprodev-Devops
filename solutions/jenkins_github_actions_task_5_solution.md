# Task 5: Manual Review

## Objective
This task outlines the steps required to prepare your project for manual review, ensuring all necessary artifacts and configurations are in place for assessment.

## 1. Ensure All Tasks are Completed and Pushed

Before requesting a manual review, ensure that you have:
*   Successfully completed all previous tasks (Task 0 to Task 4).
*   All your changes, including the `Jenkinsfile`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `.github/workflows/dep.yml`, are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.
*   The Jenkins pipelines and GitHub Actions workflows are running successfully without errors.
*   All required GitHub Secrets (`MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`) are correctly configured in your GitHub repository.
*   Your Jenkins instance is accessible and configured as per Task 0 and Task 1.

## 2. Generate Your Review Link

The project instructions mention generating a review link. This typically involves a platform-specific mechanism (e.g., an ALX-specific portal or submission system). Follow the instructions provided by your platform to generate and submit your review link.

## 3. Request Manual QA Review

Once your project is complete and the review link is generated:
1.  **Notify your instructor or lead** that your project is ready for manual QA review.
2.  **Provide the generated review link** and any other necessary access information (if applicable, though typically access is managed through the platform).
3.  **Be prepared to answer questions** or make adjustments based on the feedback received during the review process.

## 4. Auto-Check Verification

An auto-check system will likely verify the presence of core files and specific workflows. Ensure all required files (`Jenkinsfile`, `ci.yml`, `dep.yml`) are correctly located within the `messaging_app` directory as specified in the tasks.

This concludes the tasks for the Jenkins and GitHub Actions project.
